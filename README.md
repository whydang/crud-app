1. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
None at all, mainly the internet.

2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
Nope.

3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
More than 15 hours roughly. :c

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Definitely wasn't familiar with how there are so many libaries and methods for differing tools we use. I get mixed up with jQuery and all of a sudden Parse is introduced, which then introduces more method vocabs I need to recognize. Much harder than I thought.
